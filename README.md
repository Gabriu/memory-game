## Instructions

The game board is made up of 8 different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The player has to flip over 2 hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
Each turn:
-	The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
-	The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
-	If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
-	If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Score

The game is evaluated by 3 scores: moves, time and star rating.
- Moves. Each time the player flips 2 different cards, 1 move is counted.
- Time. When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
- Star rating. The player scores 3 stars when 15 or less moves are made, 2 stars are counted from 16 to 25 moves, 1 star is left when the player makes more than 25 moves.
